Codeigma is an app that allows you to take a photo of your medical bill and see the meaning of the code for each treatment your received. You can then mark each code as correct (you received the treatment) or incorrect (you received a different treatment). These codes will be saved and you can look back at your bills at any time.

Note: The most up to date code is currently on branch lexie2
